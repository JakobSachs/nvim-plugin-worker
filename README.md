# nvim-plugin-worker
The repository for collecting & updating nvim plugin repos. (kinda what neovimcraft does)

All this software is responsible is collecting and updating the stats for nvim plugins.
and storing the information into a MongoDB. Everything else like the API and the 
UI is another repos concern.
