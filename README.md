# nvim-plugin-worker
The repository for collecting & updating nvim plugin repos. (kinda what neovimcraft does)

All this software is responsible is collecting and updating the stats for nvim plugins.
and storing the information into a MongoDB. Everything else like the API and the 
UI is another repos concern.

## TODOs:

- [ ] ðŸ“‹ Find a way to gather a list of nvim-plugins (repos). _For now ill just take
a list from [here](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim/blob/main/README.md) teehee_
- [ ] 


## Tasks:


What does this software need to do:
- Keep & expand a list of nvim-plugin repos (from a variety of sources)
- Update the information in the DB every so often from querying the repos
